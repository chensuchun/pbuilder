.SH NAME
pdebuild \- pbuilder way of doing debuild
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "pdebuild [" "pdebuild options" "] \-\- [" "pbuilder options" "]"
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
A convenience program for 
.B "pbuilder"
which invokes pbuilder after obtaining appropriate root privilege 
in a Debian source directory.
One must be inside the source tree containing the
.B "debian"
directory.

By default, build log file is stored in ../<package>_<version>_<arch>.build.


.SH "PDEBUILD OPTIONS"

The options have the form
.BI "\-\-" "option name"
which modify the operation semantics as explained below.  They are
applied from left to right, and when options conflict, the option that
appear later take precedence.

.TP
.BI "\-\-buildsourceroot [" "fakeroot" "]"
The command used to gain root privilege for 
invoking dpkg-buildpackage

.TP
.BI "\-\-pbuilderroot [" "sudo -E" "]"
The command used to gain root privilege for 
invoking pbuilder.

.TP
.BI "\-\-pbuildersatisfydepends [" "/usr/lib/pbuilder/pbuilder-satisfydepends" "]"
The command used to satisfy (i.e. install) build-dependencies.

.TP
.BI "\-\-architecture"

Set architecture.  This is currently required when it doesn't match the host
architecture.

.TP
.BI "\-\-auto\-debsign"

Invoke debsign at the end of pdebuild process.

.TP
.BI "\-\-debsign\-k [" "key\-id" "]"
Pass 
.B \-k
option to debsign to specify which key-id to sign with.

.TP
.BI "\-\-buildresult [" "Directory for build results" "]"

The place where the build result is stored.

Note that for pdebuild, buildresult needs to be specified as a pdebuild
option on the command-line, not as a pbuilder option.

Note that the default value for buildresult is what is defined for
pbuilder, which is
.B "/var/cache/pbuilder/result"
and not 
.B ".."

.TP
.BI "\-\-configfile [" "Extra config file to use" "]"

The configuration file is used, and passed on to
.BR "pbuilder" .

.TP
.BI "\-\-debbuildopts [" "options to pass to dpkg-buildpackage" "]"

The space-delimited list of options are passed to dpkg-buildpackage.
This option appends to pbuilder option
.B "\-\-debbuildopts"
and may also be used to reset the list of options by passing the empty
string.

Multiple options are delimited with spaces.

Note that for pdebuild, debbuildopts needs to be specified as a pdebuild
option in the command-line, not as a pbuilder option.

.TP
.BI "\-\-use\-pdebuild\-internal"
Uses a different implementation of pdebuild, which calls clean and build inside 
the chroot, using bind-mounts.

.B "pdebuild\-internal"
tries to run debian/rules clean inside the chroot.
To do so, the working directory is passed on inside the chroot,
in the form of bind-mounting and
.B debuild 
is run.

This option will not protect the working directory and its parent directories 
from the build scripts.

.TP
.BI "\-\-logfile [" "file to log" "]"
Specifies the build logfile to create. 
The messages generated during execution will be written to the file, 
as well as standard output.

.TP
.BI "\-\-pbuilder [" "pbuilder" "]"
Specifies which command to invoke as pbuilder.

.TP
.BI "\-\-help"

Show a brief help message.

.TP
.BI "\-\- [" "pbuilder options" "]"

After the 
.B "\-\-"
symbol, an arbitrary number of pbuilder options can be specified.
See pbuilder(8) for a full list of options.


There is an exception that
.B "\-\-buildresult"
and
.B "\-\-debbuildopts"
need to be specified as pdebuild options before the 
.B "\-\-"
in order to be effective.
