.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "pdebuild\-user\-mode\-linux [" "pdebuild\-user\-mode\-linux options" "] \-\- [" "pbuilder\-user\-mode\-linux options" "]"
.PP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A convenience program for 
.B pbuilder\-user\-mode\-linux
which invokes pbuilder after obtaining appropriate root privilege 
in a Debian source directory.
One must be inside the source tree containing the
.B debian
directory, in order to make it work.

.SH "PDEBUILD OPTIONS"
.TP

.BI "\-\-buildsourceroot [" "fakeroot" "]"
The command used to gain root privilege for 
invoking dpkg-buildpackage

.TP
.BI "\-\-auto\-debsign"

Invoke debsign at the end of pdebuild process.

.TP
.BI "\-\-debsign\-k [" "key-id" "]"

Pass 
.B "\-k"
option to debsign to specify which keyid to sign.

.TP
.BI "\-\-buildresult [" "Directory for build results" "]"

The place which build result is stored.

.TP
.BI "\-\-configfile [" "Extra config file to use" "]"

The configuration file is used, but not passed on to 
.BR "pbuilder\-user\-mode\-linux" .

.TP
.BI "\-\-debbuildopts [" "options to pass to dpkg\-buildpackage" "]"

The space-delimited list of options are passed to dpkg\-buildpackage.
This option appends to pbuilder option
.B "\-\-debbuildopts"
and may also be used to reset the list of options by passing the empty string.

.TP
.BI "\-\-use\-pdebuild\-internal"
Uses a different implementation of pdebuild, which calls clean and build inside 
the chroot, using bind-mounts.

.B "pdebuild\-internal"
tries to run debian/rules clean inside the chroot.
To achieve the goal, the working directory is passed on inside the chroot,
in the form of bind-mounting and
.B debuild 
is run.

This option will not protect the working directory and its parent directories 
from the build scripts.

.TP
.BI "\-\- [" "pbuilder options" "]"

After the 
.B "\-\-"
symbol, an arbitrary number of pbuilder options can be specified.
See pbuilder-user-mode-linux.1 for full list of options.


There is an exception that
.B "\-\-buildresult"
needs to be specified as pdebuild option before the 
.B "\-\-"
to be effective.
