Description: personal package builder for Debian packages
 Constructs a chroot system, and builds a package inside the 
 chroot.
 . 
 Ideal system to use to check that Build-dependency is correct, 
 and to be sure that unnecessary and wrong build dependency will not
 exist with the resulting binary package.
 .
 pbuilder create uses debootstrap to create a chroot  image.
 .
 pbuilder update updates the image to the current state of 
 testing/unstable/whatever
 .
 pbuilder build takes a *.dsc file to build a binary in the chroot 
 image.
 .
 pdebuild is a wrapper for Debian Developers, to allow running 
 pbuilder just like "debuild", from a normal user privilege
 .
 Uses apt extensively, and a local mirror, or a fast connection
 to a Debian mirror is ideal, but not necessary.
