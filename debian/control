Description: personal package builder for Debian packages
 pbuilder constructs a chroot system, and builds a package inside the
 chroot. 
 It is an ideal system to use to check 
 that a package has correct build-dependencies.
 It uses apt extensively, and a local mirror, or a fast connection
 to a Debian mirror is ideal, but not necessary.
 .
 "pbuilder create" uses debootstrap to create a chroot image. 
 .
 "pbuilder update" updates the image to the current state of
 testing/unstable/whatever
 .
 "pbuilder build" takes a *.dsc file and builds a binary in the chroot
 image.
 .
 pdebuild is a wrapper for Debian Developers, to allow running
 pbuilder just like "debuild", as a normal user.

Description: user-mode-linux version of pbuilder
 pbuilder-uml uses a User-mode-linux system, and builds Debian packages
 inside the UML image. It is an ideal system to use to check 
 that a package has correct build-dependencies.
 It uses apt extensively, and a local mirror, or a fast connection
 to a Debian mirror is ideal, but not necessary.

 Requires user-mode-linux to function correctly

 "pbuilder-user-mode-linux create" uses rootstrap to create UML image
