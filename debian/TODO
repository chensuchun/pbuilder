TODO and possible bugs: 

* lenny goal!:
   - support --allow-unauthenticated and package signatures; #317998
pbuilder support for signatures will hopefully come

* apt authentication support
Add hooks to install gnupg package.
Allow new keys to be registered into pbuilder chroots.
Document in manual.
test


* /etc/pbuilderrc
I want to not make it a conffile, but removing the file is a problem,
   since I already have /etc/pbuilder/pbuilderrc symlink.

* pdebuild-internal
   - Use pbuilder cache in pdebuild-internal (235237)
I think I just need to add hacks to copy stuff.
   - testsuite for pdebuild-internal?
   - support readlink -e usage instead of readlink -f.

This is too trivial, but anyway. Debian 3.1 does not support 
'readlink -e'.

* xvfb:x11-common
   - debian-bug: 337541: fixed in 0.138
/etc/init.d/x11-common needs to be ran; policy-rc.d is now patched.
Remaining problem is the upgrade case, and when base.tgz already 
contains xvfb.

Maybe document the limitation.

* use arrays for debbuildopts
   - current --debbuildopts usages will break, how do we support it?

* revert back to using --variant=buildd for debootstrap
   - depends-on debian-bug: 314858 debootstrap: fixed in 0.3.2

* BUG: Too many options! Creeping featurism!!

* Fix pbuilder-user-mode-linux bind-mount, 
   -  Use hostfs for better performance, 
   -  fix space-handling in, use arrays

* Build dependency handles |, but not when [] and | exist. -- no package should be using it ?

* Machine type specification in Build dependency should either have  [!xxx !xxx !xxx ...] or [xxx xxx xxx ...]   [!xxx xxx] formats are not parsed, and should really not exist.

* sbuild interface

* Remember to update the TODO file.

* Support for apt-move. Some, mount --bind trick 
   - documentation of how to do it
   - putting example scripts.
         
* Supporting really automatic/noninteractive "pbuilder upgrade"
   - user-mode-linux is noninteractive, it no longer umounts.
   - policy-rc.d is in place, everything should be automatic modulo bugs.

* $HOME, $TMP, $TMPDIR, etc. environment vars are set to bogus values

* set LOGNAME=root ? 
   - related debian-bug: 166682
   - perl spits out warning every time it starts up if LOGNAME is unset.

* check cross-compile support, maybe adding support for dpkg-cross into build-depends checker?

* Fix UML_EXTRAOPT to use arrays.
This should change semantics; and how do we pass this thing to inside UML?
